> **Abstract:** *A good image-to-image translation model should learn a mapping between different visual domains while satisfying the following properties: 1) diversity of generated images and 2) scalability over multiple domains. Existing methods address either of the issues, having limited diversity or multiple models for all domains. We propose StarGAN v2, a single framework that tackles both and shows significantly improved results over the baselines. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and a new animal faces dataset (AFHQ) validate our superiority in terms of visual quality, diversity, and scalability. To better assess image-to-image translation models, we release AFHQ, high-quality animal faces with large inter- and intra-domain variations. The code, pre-trained models, and dataset are available at clovaai/stargan-v2.*

## Software installation
Install the dependencies:
```bash
conda create -n stargan-v2 python=3.6.7
conda activate stargan-v2
conda install -y pytorch=1.4.0 torchvision=0.5.0 cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
conda install x264=='1!152.20180717' ffmpeg=4.0.2 -c conda-forge

```
Download the pretrained repository for AFHQ

```bash
bash download.sh pretrained-network-afhq
```

## Running the code
To evaluate StarGAN v2 using [Fr&eacute;chet Inception Distance (FID)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500) and [Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03924), run the following commands:

```bash

# afhq
python main.py 
```
